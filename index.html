            <p class="right">Hello, there!<br><br>
                My name is Katie, and I'm a sagittarius living in Brooklyn, New York by way of the Sunshine State. These days I spend my time accidentally killing all of my boyfriend's plants in our Bushwick apartment and learning how to code. In past lives I've also been a ballerina, flea market funnel-cake maker, & yoga instructor.</p>
            <p class="right">While living in Florida I attended the University of Central Florida, where I studied psychology but mostly hung out in the local punk and art scenes. Fast-forward to four years later as I entered "adulthood", and I quickly realized that I didn't actually want to be a therapist, nor was there much of a future career in hanging out at punk shows. I've since found myself spending the better part of this last decade working in Retail Operations and Project Management. From running flagship stores in Rockefeller Plaza to managing store openings across the country, it sometimes feels like I've done it all.</p>
            <p>I made the move to New York City in August of 2015 in search of opportunity and growth in my career, which I quickly found with companies like Free People and Birchbox. Since then, however, the retail industry has been changing drastically with e-commerce taking over traditional brick and mortar. As this industry changes, I've realized I need to change with it. Therefore, this summer I made the bold move to leave the comfort of my job as a retail project manager. I'm now enrolled in the Columbia Engineering Coding Boot Camp to become a software engineer, and I can't wait to explore this new chapter of my life.</p>
